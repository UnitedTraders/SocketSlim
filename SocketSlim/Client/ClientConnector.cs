    /// Typical workflow with this class should be as follows:
    /// * Create an object with the constructor.
    /// * Fill in <see cref="Address"/> and <see cref="Port"/> and subscribe to <see cref="Connected"/>
    ///   and <see cref="Failed"/> events.
    /// * Call the <see cref="Connect"/> method to initiate connection.
    /// * You can interrupt connection operation anytime by calling <see cref="StopConnecting"/> method.
    /// * If connection has succeded, the <see cref="Connected"/> event will be raised with an opened data socket as an argument.
    /// * If connection failed, the <see cref="Failed"/> event willl be raised with the reason for the failure.
    /// * After either success or failure, this object can be reused to open another connections to different hosts by
    ///   changing <see cref="Address"/> and <see cref="Port"/> properties and calling <see cref="Connect"/> method again.
